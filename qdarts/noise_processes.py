class AbstractNoiseProcess(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    Models a noise process that produces possibly dependent samples :math:`\epsilon(v)_t`. The noise process
    can depend on the device voltages v and the noise can depend on all previous samples in the sequence. We assume
    that :math:`\epsilon(v)_t` is vector valued and the number of elements is stored in the num_elements attribute
    
    A sequence is started by calling start_sequence, at which point the newly sampled points are independent from
    all previous samples. 
    
    Note that currently, the elements in the noise process are assumed to be drawn with equal time difference between samples.
