    """Base class for all objects that create device simulations from a Capacitive Model.
    
    This class includes all tools to compute and cache polytopes from the provided capacitive model.
    Polytopes are queried using a call to boundaries() which queries the internal cache and then 
    computes the polytope on demand.
    
    The computed polytope P(n) is the set of voltages v for which n is the ground state of the capacitance
    energy function E(v,n), i.e., n=min_n' E(v,n'). A facet of the polytope is given by the equality 
    E(v,n')-E(v,n) = 0 for a suitable choice of n'. As a result, when shooting a ray through
    a facet of the polytope created by state n', there is a transition from state n->n' in the ground state.
    
    The computation of the polytope discards by default all states and inequalitis that do not form a facet of P(n).
    However, this can be relaed by allowing a maximum slack, which also keeps facets for which 
    min_v E(v,n')-E(v,n) < max_slack, where v is restricted to elements in the polytope P(n). i.e., max slack keeps facet
    in which the energy difference is small.
