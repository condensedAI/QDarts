        estimation of the conductance g with two noise sources. A fast noise source

        and a slow noise source that models time dependent noise between different invocations

        height and with of the peak can be adapted. Currently, all sensor dots share these 
        parameters.
        
        The noise can be configured via config_noise. The noise is modeled as an additive 
        noise on the sensor peak position in voltage space. Thus, at peaks or valleys, the noise
        is small while on the sides of the peak, where the derivatives are largest, the noise will
        affect measurements the most. Additional signal  noise is then modeled by adding white gaussian noise.

class ApproximateTunnelingSimulator(AbstractPolytopeSimulator):
    """Simulator for approximate charge tunneling in a quantum dot device.
    
    The simulator extends the supplied capacitive simulation by creating a Hamiltionian H,
    where on the diagonals are the capacitive energies of the simualation, while the off-diagonals
    have added tunnel coupling parameters. Locally the hamiltonian is approximated via L basis states,
    where each state is an electron configurtion on the dots. This mixed state is then used to create a sensor simulation.
    
    It is possible to query the state of single hamiltonian, their mixed state and their sensor simulation via the class
    LocalSystem, returned by compute_local_system, but the primary use of tis class lies in its ability to compute
    1D or 2D sensor scans via sensor_scan and sensor_scan_2D.
    
    For computing the tunnel coupling parameters, this class can make use of an additional Tunnel barrier simulation, but it
    is also possible to just supply a NxN constant matrix of tunnel couplings between all D dots in the array. 
    
    Finally, the class follows the interface of AbstractPolytopeSimulator, which means it is possible to directly query the information
    of the underlying polytopes of the simulation. This is there to unify slicing between simulators.
    
    Implementation details:
    
    The basis used for a gate voltage v is queried by finding its ground states n and then the facets of the
    ground state polytope P(n) create the basis. Thus, this basis becomes extended as the slack variable in the underlying
    capacitance simulation is increased. This is called the core state set.
    Additionally, the simulation allows to add additional states. For example, for most sensor simulations to work, we also need
    other higher energy states to compute correct conductance. These additional states can be added by modifying the vector
    num_additional_neighbours. if the ith element in this vector is R>0, and s is a state in the core basis, then
    the extended basis will also include the states :math:`s+ke_i` where :math:`|k|<=R` and :math:`e_i` is the ith basis vector.
    
    The tunnel couplings T are included into the Hamiltonian the following way: let :math:`s_i` and :math:`s_j` be two states in the basis of the Hamiltonian
    that differ only in the value of the electron configuration at dots i and j. 
    More exactly, we have that :math:`s_i` and :math:`s_j` are related by moving an electron from state :math:`s_i` to :math:`s_j` or vice versa. 
    Let :math:`H_{kl}` be the off-diagonal matrix element of those states. Then we have :math:`H_{kl} = T_{ij}`. 
    In all other cases, tunnel coupling is 0.
    
    The mixed state is then again computed approximately, for more info on that, see documentation of LocalSystem.
    
    The sensor signal of the computed mixed state is computed via the sensor_sim.

    num_additional_neighbours: np.array of ints
        for each dot defines how many additional states should be added for each state in the core basis. This is done
        by adding or subtracting electrons on the ith element where the maximum is given by the ith element of num_additional_neighbours.
        We advise to set this to 2 for sensor dots. Note that computation time can quickly explode when increasing this parameter.
        Outside of sensor dots, we advise therefore to increase the slack in the capacitive simulation.
