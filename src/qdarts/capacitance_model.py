class AbstractCapacitanceModel(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Base Class for all capacitance models. 
    
    This class provides all required meta information to compute capacitive energies of a system with electron configuration
    n and gate voltages v, E(v,n). The only required to this model is that E(v,n)-E(v,n') is a linear function in v and that energies
    are measured in eV.
    The class provides basic abilities: enumeration of possible transition states from a given state and computation/verification of a polytope P(n) for a state.
    For this, the user only needs to provide functions to generate transition equations and a function that allows to slice the voltage space.
    
    As a base class it only needs to know the number of gates/inputs and the number of dots of the array. Additionally
    the user must supply voltage bounds that ensure that all computed polytopes are bounded. In practical devices these would be voltage limits
    e.g., for device protection.

    ----------
    num_dots: int
