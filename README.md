# Qatpack
Efficient Simulation of Charge Transitions in Quantum Dot Arrays with Sensor Dots, Tunnel Couplings, and Variable Charging Energy


## Installation
The package supports Python 3.6 and later. To install the package, run the following command:
 
 '''
    pip install qatpack
 '''

## Manuscript
The package is based on the manuscript "" by J.A. Krzywda, "", "", "". The manuscript is available at ARXIV

## Examples
    The package provides a simple example to demonstrate the usage of the package. The example is available in the examples qatpack/examples folder. The example demonstrates the simulation of a quantum dot array with sensor dots, tunnel couplings, and non-constant charging energy. 

    As a proof of principle, in the example we reconstruct the figure from the paper Neyens, S. F. et al., Measurements of capacitive coupling within a quadruple-quantum-dot array. Physical Review Applied, 12(6), 064049
